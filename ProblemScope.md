## BeakSpeak - Problem and Context

Purpose of this document is to provide further context regarding BeakSpeak. This is meant mostly for the team to better understand the nature of the problem in order to derive key product insights for the anonymous social platform. 

## Context

#### *BeakSpeak Problem*

We have a lot of residential college pride, which is great because the residential college system does a good job of establishing a warm, welcoming community you come to call family! Unfortunately, this system tends to be socially divisive and at times suffocating. People stick with their residential communities and don't feel encouraged to branch out to engage with the greater Rice society -- this leads to a lot of residential pride and very low Rice pride! Other evidence of low Rice pride is the poor student perception of Rice athletics, where this attitude is a historically core indicator of how students feel about their institution. To add to that, we found through customer research that people, in fact, DO want to expand their social interactions beyond their own residential college, but they do not feel there is enough effort being made to bridge that gap among residential colleges. Therefore, the problem is that the current health of Rice pride and interconnectivy is poor, and improvement is desired but not currently met by the current situation outlined below.      

#### *Current Situation*

Current technologies students use to stay connected are Facebook, Groupme, and Snapchat. The problems with these are:
1. All carry the burden of identity
2. Restricted social interactions because of group structure
3. Some (Groupme) are used more for productivity than socializing
4. Others (Snapchat) are used to interact with a small group of people
5. Distracting clutter of information

Furthermore, residential colleges host a lot of inner-college events, which are great at strengthening bonds already in place but not so much at forming new connections. This stands in stark contrast to (lack of) inter-college/campus-wide events that ought to balance the residential system. While RPC does a phenomenal job of hosting major social events ie dances like Rondelet and Esperanza, these events are few and far in-between. Plus they do not offer much potential for forming new connections as, once again, the culture for such events is to go in groups.  

#### *Underserved Need*

**Is interconnectivity important?**

For a healthy, happy campus life, a connected community is super important. Interconnectivity fosters Rice pride that acts as a unifiying force, which strengthens the student body. A strong student body is one where everyone feels like they belong and can relate with one another. This matters because the image we try to build at Rice is an inclusive image, so if even one person feels isolated, alone, or that they don't belong, that is a problem worth solving. Just take Rice athletics for example-- wouldn't you, an athlete who commits so much time to make your institution proud, feel sad if you felt like very little people cared?  

**Components of Interconnectivity**

Interconnectivity can be broken down into the following components:
1. Widely accessible and realtime communication
2. Freedom of expression
3. Safety and Security

A discussion of each component:
+ Widely accessible and realtime communication
    + Interconnectivity cannot be achieved without this aspect. Part of connecting a whole network of people necessitates a framework that can be accessed by any Rice student, anywhere and anytime. This combats the issue of interactions being localized to a residential college.
+ Freedom of expression
    + What keeps people connected and feeling like they belong to something bigger than themselves is a shared resource of experiences -- whether that's memes, unpopular opinions, or what everyone is thinking but too afraid to say.   
+ Safety and Security
    + If we don't get this part right, no one will use our app; like YikYak, if the app is allowed unregulated anonymity, then the harsh consequences are cyber-bullying, threats, etc. Furthermore, creating a safe environment contributes towards people opening up and feeling comfortable to the point they can share their rawest thoughts without excessive adversity. There's a difference between an unpopular opinion and bullying, and we intend to keep that line very clear.

#### *Problem Scope*

**How do we encourage interconnectivity in the student body by using technology?**

We have established that Rice has an interconnectivity problem. We would like to use mobile technology to accomplish this because phones and etc are generally used by the vast majority of students. Additionally, effective intterconnectivity is one where you can be connected to your community anytime and anywhere; this requirement is best met by mobile technology. 

One important predecessor that addressed this problem was YikYak -- it was a massivley popular anonymous social app back in the day used widely at several colleges. People loved it because it allowed them to express their raw, honest thoughts and feel like they could relate to the campus community. Unfortunately, due to moderation issues, the app was shut down. The key ideas we can draw from YikYak's success is that anonymity, when kept in check, can be a powerful tool to get people comfortable with sharing their experiences. When people share their experiences, the more they can relate to each other and feel connected, which is what people are missing due to factors such as the restrictive residential college system.  

#### *Customer Research*

After conducting surveys, we learned much of what has been discussed already in this document:
1. The residential college system is socially restrictive
2. There are not enough opportunities to socialize outside of one's residential college
3. Current social outlets are good at maintaining current connections and productivity but not at forming new ones
4. People are most comfortable with anonymous outlets when cyber safety is prioritized
5. Most importantly, people appreciate anonymity because of the raw, relatable moments -- older interviewees even expressed missing YikYak for this purpose

Insight: We will be using Rice IDP for authentiation to ensure only Rice students can use our product.
